# Clipshare
A lightweight clip sharing service written in Svelte and using Pocketbase. Clipshare does not have many features, as it is more of a proof-of-concept, but it still meets its intended target goal.

### Why?
I needed a self-hostable service that could easily upload and share clips with my friends, and other services weren't doing it for me, so I decided that it would be a learning experience, and started working on Clipshare.

### Features:
- Uploading Videos
- Deleting Videos
- Creating an Account
- Video Descriptions

### Tech Stack:
- Svelte Kit
- Pocketbase
